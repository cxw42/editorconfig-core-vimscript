EditorConfig Project
====================

EditorConfig makes it easy to maintain the correct coding style when switching
between different text editors and between different projects.  The
EditorConfig project maintains a file format and plugins for various text
editors which allow this file format to be read and used by those editors.  For
information on the file format and supported text editors, see the
[EditorConfig website](http://editorconfig.org>).
